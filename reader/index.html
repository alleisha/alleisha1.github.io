    <h1>LOSING YOUR OWN SELF</h1>
    <h5>Jinghuai Lin and Erich Latoschik</h5>
    <p1>Social Virtual Reality (social VR or SVR) provides digital spaces for diverse human activities, social interactions, and embodied face-to-face encounters. While our digital bodies in SVR can in general be of almost any conceivable appearance, individualized or even personalized avatars bearing users’ likeness recently became an interesting research topic. Such digital bodies show a great potential to enhance the authenticity of social VR citizens and increase the trustworthiness of interpersonal interaction. However, using such digital bodies might expose users to privacy and identity issues such as identity theft: For instance, how do we know whether the avatars we encounter in the virtual world are who they claim to be? Safeguarding users’ identities and privacy, and preventing harm from identity infringement, are crucial to the future of social VR. </p1>
    <h2>Unlike physical bodies, the digital bodies can be altered or changed at the users’ will, which allow them to disguise their identity</h2>
   <p2>  identity theft will easily occur as cybercriminals “steal” or generate avatars of others and pretend to be them (Lake, 2020). In other words, the “authenticity” (whether one’s identity online or in the virtual world is who one claims to be and can be identified with a unique identity in reality) of a social VR citizen cannot be guaranteed. Social VR applications where users enter as themselves and use their personalized avatars (e.g., Spatial. io) are not without limitations. For example, identity verification is still lacking (in Spatial. io, so long as a photo is provided, users can generate and use a personalized avatar from that photo regardless of whom it belongs to), therefore the authenticity of the identity still cannot be guaranteed. It has been widely reported that identity thefts and phishing attacks exist in video conferencing using “deepfake” and similar technologies (Cole, 2020; McElroy, 2021). It will not be surprising that similar cybercrimes targeting avatars will occur in social VR.5,6   </p2>
    <h3>The authenticity of the identity still cannot be guaranteed</h3>
    <p3>With the aforementioned future trend of social VR, there will be significant challenges and necessities in protecting users’ digital bodies, building the authenticity of social VR citizens, and protecting them from identity misappropriation. Such efforts are essential in enhancing the trust among social VR citizens and increasing people’s acceptance of social VR, as the trustworthiness of avatars has a significant and favorable influence on net-based social activities and collaboration (Bente et al., 2014; Chae et al., 2016; Pan and Steed, 2016; Pan and Steed, 2017). In addition, providing a trustworthy, intelligent, and comfortable virtual environment is the prerequisite for building human-centered social VR that everyone can trust and enjoy.</p3>
